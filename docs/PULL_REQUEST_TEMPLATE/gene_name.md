## Gene model name proposal

|||
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| gene model      | XLOC                   |
| Gene name       | *ACRONYM* (FULL NAME)  |
| Sequence source | [SOURCE](URL_HERE)     |

### Annotation process

- If you started from a known (published) sequence: where did you get it from? Please link the [sequence source](URL) and the [relevant publication](URL) here.
- What indicated that the proposed XLOC corresponds to this gene? For instance, did it map to the P. dum. v021 transcriptome using BLASTn (JÃ©kely Lab)? If so, link the [search results](URL).
- Did you confirm in any way that the XLOC you tentatively identified as *acronym* is indeed what you think it is? For instance, when mapping the XLOC sequence to NCBI's *nr* database, do you get the expected results? If so, link the [search results](URL), or upload an [image]().

- If you started from an unknown (unpublished) _Platynereis_ sequence, what evidence convinced you that it is the gene you think it is? Please share the relevant evidence, such as gene trees.

### Comments

- (optional) Do you have any comments concerning the nomenclature? Did you come up with the name or is it named in the publication? Does the name come from invertebrates (e.g. Drosophila, C. elegans) or is it a vertebrate name? Is it a many-to-many ortholog/one-to-many/many-to-one/one-to-one?
- Is there anything else that needs to be known for the community to make an informed decision about the proposed gene name?
